# ChristmasForChange
Being out of the daily ratrace, with family, an opportunity for going green ?

First you see a typical Christmas setting that brings you in a happy open mood

Second a shock is induced by pointing out many of those things are really bad for the climate (woodstove, meat eating, parked cars, non-durable presents)

Third, suggestions are given to discuss with the family, during these days you finally have the time for some proper talking and realizing being with family and being healthy is much more important than money and stuff.
